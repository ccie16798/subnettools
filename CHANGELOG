v1.5 (unreleased)
=================

- Internal changes
-- optimized read_csv when delims is only ONE (common case)
-- simplified some iptools func for speed
-- rewrite major parts of st_scanf pattern matching engine
-- scanf mutliplier handling (+, *, ?) was trying to be generic, dividing it into 3 separates cases helps
readability a lot, speeds up and simplify code

v1.4
====
-New features
-- bitmask printing (with compression 4, ie use '%I4' in fmt)
-- Extensible Attribute attached to routes, can be also filtered

- Miscellaneous new commands
-- 'compare'  now returns all relations (INCLUDED, INCLUDES, EQUALS)
-- subnetcmp before after : prints all changes that occurs between 'before' and 'after'; you should use typically after you change your routing

- new IPAM commands and IPAM infrastructure
-- ipamprint  (Example : ./subnettools -ea EA-Site,EA-Vlan,comment ipamprint ipam.csv )
-- ipamfilter (Example : ./subnettools -ea EA-Site,EA-Vlan,comment ipamfilter ipam.csv 'EA-Vlan<2000&EA-Site=Acheres')
-- getea (Example : ./subnettools -EA-Site,comment getea ipam.csv toto)

- Internal changes
-- st_malloc infrastructure to track memory leaks
-- struct route a no more comment field, just Extensible Attributes
-- many modification to CSV helpers, to load files with varying number of Extensible Attributes
-- checked by checkpatch.pl from Linux

v1.3
====
-New features
-- filter & bgpfilter commands (filter on GW, prefix, AS_PATH, etc... in any logical combination)
-- add 'uniq' commands, prints routes from FILE1 & FILE2 that have no relation
-- remove diff command, that never worked properly
-- bgpprint according to a format!

-Internal changes
-- bug fixes (didnt properly scan 'sh ip bgp' , because some subnets are ... classfull)
-- rewritten string2mask low level function
-- improved error reporting (with -V, -VV), debug message levels are more consistent

v1.2
====
-New features
--ecmp options to print all routes in case the source files has multiples NH to same destination
--many fixes in converters
--sortby, bgpsorty commands to sort BGP routes, subnet routes
--revamped help (in categories)
--can compile on freebsd now

v1.1
====
New features :
- converters now supports '-rt' option to set comment to route type (ospf, bgp, static ....)
- converter for show route on ASA
-BGP tools :
-- converter to load a BGP table
-- bgpcmp command to show differences between a table, after some UPDATES

v1.0
====
- New features
-- network split
-Internal changes
-- lot of cleanups, scanf work
-- all converters converted to st_scanf

v0.7
====
-Internal changes
-- st_scanf pattern matching engine
-- few visible changes for the end user, except a new 'scanf' command
-- rewriting and hardening of low -level IPv4/IPv6 parsing functions

v0.6
====
- New features
--ipinfo :
subnettools ipinfo 'subnet' can give the following informations about 'subnet'
- network address, last subnet address
- known prefix membership (IPv6 global addresses, RFC 1918 private subnet, multicast, etc...)
Decoding of following addresses :
- Teredo
- IPv6 multicast (including embedded RP)
- 6to4
- ISATAP link-local address
- IPv4 glop
- rfc 6052
- EUI-64 Interface ID
